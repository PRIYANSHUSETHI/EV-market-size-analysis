# Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Size Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts the electric vehicle (EV) market size using a dataset containing EV registration and population data. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning-based forecasting to understand EV adoption trends, geographical distribution, and future market growth.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv`, which contains information about registered electric vehicles, including model year, county, and other relevant attributes.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- The first few rows are displayed to understand the structure of the data.
- Data types and column information are examined using `info()`.
- Missing values are identified using `isnull().sum()` and removed using `dropna()`.

### 2. Data Visualization & Analysis
#### EV Adoption Over Time
- The project analyzes the number of EV registrations per model year.
- A bar plot is created using Seaborn to visualize the trend of EV adoption over time.

#### Geographical Distribution
- The dataset is used to analyze the number of EV registrations across different counties.
- A visualization is generated to show which counties have the highest adoption rates.

### 3. Predictive Modeling for Market Size Forecasting
- A machine learning model is used to predict the future market size of EV adoption.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- Models such as `LinearRegression` or `RandomForestRegressor` are trained on historical EV adoption data.
- Predictions are evaluated and visualized to understand future trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning for predictive modeling

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy by incorporating additional socio-economic and policy-related factors.
- Implement deep learning models for better prediction performance.
- Integrate real-time data sources to keep forecasts updated.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the trends and geographical distribution of electric vehicle adoption. By leveraging machine learning models, it also offers predictive capabilities to forecast future market size. The analysis can aid policymakers, manufacturers, and investors in making informed decisions about the EV market's growth trajectory.
